# CIG Customer Service Chatbot - I

## Project Mission/Motivation
The Capital Insurance Group (CIG) is a regional property and casualty insurer, 
serving the Western U.S since 1898. It is important that customer inquiries about 
these services are addressed as efficiently and effectively as possible. Currently, 
the only available options for contacting Client Service Representatives include 
support by telephone or redirecting customers to visit local offices. The chatbot 
would reduce these (frequently asked) questions and allow the representatives to 
focus on more complex questions.
